TONIGHT!
We are super proud to be part of the grand opening of Elbphilharmonie Hamburg.
Together with Madhat Gmbh and the supercrew of Sebastian Neitsch + Juliane Götz, Sal Litre and intolight we created an audio reactive projection mapping show - made with vvvv, that will illuminate the Elbphilharmonie to the live orchestra in real time.
The event will be streamed live at: www.Elphi.me and Facebook, or can be watched at german television NDR.
(Uiuiui!)
