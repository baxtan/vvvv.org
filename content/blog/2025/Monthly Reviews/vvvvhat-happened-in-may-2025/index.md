There goes another month...

First off, we had [a great vvvv meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXaUijAvuWw&ab_channel=TheNODEInstitute) again, with many inspiring contributions!

Then we officially released the [Arm builds of vvvv](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-vvvv-on-arm-for-windows-and-mac-phase-1/2/) that also allow you to run vvvv quite smoothly on recent Macs (via Parallels).

And finally we released [an update to VL.OpenCV](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/vl.opencv-4.0.0-is-out-now/) with a lot of little improvements. While at it, we also recorded two new episodes for vvvvTv:

- [S02 E11: Introduction to OpenCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjw2m8w6RNU&ab_channel=vvvvTv)
- [S02 E12: AR using OpenCV with ArUco Markers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7DWMET-qM8&ab_channel=vvvvTv)

In the background we're still shaping the upcoming vvvv gamma 7.0 release. One of the things we're still finalizing is the way we create bindings to different protocols. Here is a glimpse at the new Channel Browser Binding section. In most cases establishing a binding should not be more than the click of a checkbox. Again I'm afraid we'll have to ask for some more patience though...
