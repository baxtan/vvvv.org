So I'd say, 

we're closing in on the 7.0 release. It may still take a while, but we've tackled the most pressing issues. What you see now in [the previews](https://vvvv.org/download/) is mostly what you'll get. So now is a good moment to test-drive and report your findings while we go into the polishing phase... 

Meanwhile, if you feel like socializing, join us for the [27th worldwide online meetup](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/27.-vvvv-worldwide-meetup/).
