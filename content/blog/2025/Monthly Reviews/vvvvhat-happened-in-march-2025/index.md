Spring!

So here is what we've been up to last month:
- We had a meetup and you can [rewatch it on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt0QJ2vHtyE&list=PL2KeRstDQVRQUgSEa604MaS3HtA8UgPUt&index=1)
- We've added [Support for Network Cameras by Axis](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-support-for-network-cameras-by-axis/)
- There is now a [Commandline Compiler for .vl files](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-vvvvc.exe/)
- We've opened a new chat room where we want to hear from you: [vvvvhatshappening](https://matrix.to/#/#vvvvhats-happening:matrix.org)

Our main focus right now: Finalizing the 7.0 release. Will we manage in April?
