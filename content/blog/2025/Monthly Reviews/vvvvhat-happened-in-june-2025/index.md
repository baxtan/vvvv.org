As hot as the summer,

are our brains, cooking vvvv gamma 7.0 for you. We want it al dente. And it decided to still take a moment. Who would have thought that Public Channels, Presets and Bindings all together are such a hard nut to crack. Certainly not us...

Meanwhile we can report:
- Re-introduction of Personal, Business and Educational Institution profiles on the website is imminent
- Good progress on the Avateering front: Controlling 3d avatars with 3d tracking APIs has never been easier. And we're not only talking about vvvv here. Expect a demo this month!
- An as of today totally secret little NuGet has also reached final review state. Get your inner motion designer ready for this demo. Also expected for this month!

That's from us, but then:

If you're into robots make sure not to miss the presentation of [VL.Bunraku](https://youtu.be/S4nrUpL4Mzg?t=9004) by [amir](/people/amir), as part of the [Creative Robotics Masterclass](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss25-cm-creative-robotics/).

And be sure to save the date: **[Next meetup on July 17th](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/29.-vvvv-worldwide-meetup/)** or [get notified on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npr0K63bKZc&list=PL2KeRstDQVRQUgSEa604MaS3HtA8UgPUt&index=1&ab_channel=TheNODEInstitute).
