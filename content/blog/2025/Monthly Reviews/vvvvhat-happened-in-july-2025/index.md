And just like that,

half of 2025 is already a goner again. But uh has July been active:

First the [29th vvvv meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npr0K63bKZc&list=PL2KeRstDQVRQUgSEa604MaS3HtA8UgPUt&ab_channel=TheNODEInstitute) happend, once again giving a great insight what's currently cooking in the community. And coming up: There'll be a **[special edition meetup on September 6](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/vvvv-worldwide-meetup-@-ars-electronica-festival/)** during this years [Ars Electronica](https://ars.electronica.art/festival) in Linz!

We made a [first demonstration of our work on effortless avateering](https://youtu.be/Npr0K63bKZc?list=PL2KeRstDQVRQUgSEa604MaS3HtA8UgPUt&t=5666) and you can already test this yourself using the newly released [VL.DollarsMoCap](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-dollarsmocap/) NuGet. Support for depthcameras like AzureKinect, Orbbec Femto, Stereolabs ZED is in the works. 

Then we finally officially launched what we've been working on for quite a while now and what was mostly holding back the upcoming vvvv gamma 7.0 release. Please check these 3 blog posts if you haven't already:
- [Introducing: Public Channels](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-public-channels/)
- [Introducing: Presets and Transitions](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-presets-and-transitions/)
- [Introducing: Channel Bindings](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-channel-bindings/)

We also released a new NuGet to easily use Orbbec Femto Bolt and Mega devices via the known AzureKinect set of nodes, see: [Introducing: Support for Orbbec Femto devices via K4A](https://vvvv.org/blog/2025/introducing-support-for-orbbec-femto-devices-via-k4a/)

And then, latest vvvv gamma previews got these little game-changers added that will save you a ton of clicks and key-presses:
- Auto-completion for the type editor 
- F2 to rename the definition of a selected node
- Ctrl+Shift+X to cut the definition of a selected node
