[Creative Robotics Masterclass](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/ss25-cm-creative-robotics/) starting on May 7th as part of [the NODE Institute's Summer Season 2025](https://thenodeinstitute.org/summer-season-2025/).


Hosted by [Amir](https://amirbastan.com/) of [Creative Robotics](https://creativerobotics.at/), this masterclass examines how robots can function as creative collaborators in artistic practice. Far from mere automation, robotic systems become expressive partners for interactive installations, dynamic visual designs and experimental fabrications. Participants will explore human–robot interaction through conceptual lenses, introducing ideas such as parallel and quasi-interaction, and engage with exemplary artworks before developing their own projects.

Over six online sessions and one in-person workshop, you will:

- Frame the Question

Investigate what it means to work with robots artistically, challenging assumptions about human–machine engagement and introducing key interaction concepts.

- Analyse Artistic Applications

Review case studies where robotics serve a conceptual role, considering how mechanical agency reshapes artistic experience.

- Design Interaction and Narrative

Learn to craft meaningful, surprising encounters, whether with virtual or physical agents, through structured creative exercises and peer discussion.

- Get Hands-On with Programming

Discover [Bunraku](https://amirbastan.com/projects/bunraku/), a vvvv-based control library. Set up your environment (Windows-compatible, and on Mac via Parallels) and experiment with OSC or MQTT communication.

- Collaborate in Simulation

Join a real-time online simulation of a KUKA arm, observing how multiple users influence robotic behaviour and testing small interactive experiments.

- Polish Your Project

Receive one-to-one and group consultations to refine your concept into a deliverable artwork ahead of the finale.

- Live Interaction

At [Zoenoteka](https://zoenoteka.com/) in Neukölln, Berlin, work hands-on translating your ideas into open-ended experiments and reflecting on your creative journey.


Remote participation in the final showcase is supported, ensuring everyone’s work is documented and credited. This course equips artists, designers, performers and creative coders with conceptual frameworks and practical tools to integrate robotics into the arts.
