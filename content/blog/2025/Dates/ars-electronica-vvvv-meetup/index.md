##  Want to share your work?
Please do! Anything more or less related to vvvv, yourself and your projects. Share some thoughts, share your funny fails. Or just join and vibe with us... Submissions are welcome, please drop us a line (mail below).

## Do I need to know vvvv or VL to join this meetup?
No, absolutely not. The presentations will be about projects, patches, plugins or contributions made with or for vvvv, but you do not need to know it to enjoy the meetup.

<!--
## Do you have space to host a hub in your city?
Great to hear! Hosting a watch party in your city is a great way to extend your network and connect with other patchers from your area. Let us know if you plan to do so (mail below), so we can add your location to this post.
