Dear patchers,

here is to introduce support for network cameras by [Axis](https://www.axis.com).

*"As the industry leader in video surveillance, we develop and supply innovative network solutions that improve security, safety, operational efficiency, and business intelligence for our customers across the world."* and now plug'n'play with vvvv!

[![Axis Network Cameras](axis-cameras.png)](https://www.axis.com/products/network-cameras)

Based on their [VAPIXÂ® APIs](https://developer.axis.com/vapix/) we've created the [VL.Devices.Axis](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Devices.Axis) package, implementing a node for you to quickly access the stream of such a camera.

The API's for these cameras are vast. Currently only choosing a streams resolution, fps and toggling the IRCut filter are implemented. If you need support for a specific API, it can most likely be added without too much effort.
