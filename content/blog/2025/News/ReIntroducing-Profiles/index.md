Dear Patchers, Businesses and Educators!

If you've been with vvvv for long enough, you might remember our earlier websites' feature of user- and business profiles that hadn't made it over to this new website yet. Today, we're bringing these back!

## Community visibility
The main idea of these profiles is that we get a bit of a better inter-community visibility. The **[Community](/community)** page aggregates infos from the profiles and renders an overview of who is where, who offers what skills/services, job announcements, latest contributions, tutorials and more. So this page is meant to become the number one entry-point regarding anything community.

## Edit your Profile
To make yourself visible, please head over to **[editing your profile](/community/edit/)**. When prompted to log in, use the same credentials like you use for the forum. 

As of now we have 4 profiles you can manage: 

- Personal: An introduction about yourself, links to your other online activities
- For Hire: Offering your vvvv expertise to the community
- Business: Offering your services in case you run a business
- Educational Institution: In case you represent an institution that teaches vvvv

Thanks for being part of our lovvvvely community and sharing information on your profiles. Hope this will help us all to get to know each other better!
